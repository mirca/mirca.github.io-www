Hello world!

I love Python and I love the fact that Python is being used in science and engineering
more than <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/computing/software/the-2017-top-programming-languages">ever</a>!
Python has a mature set of general purposes libraries that aid scientists extract the
best out of their data.

Numpy (numerical computation), Scipy (scientific programming), Matplotlib (visualization),
Pandas (data processing), and Scikit-learn (data science/machine learning), are only
a few of the awesome myriad of open source libraries developed in Python.

Part of the success around Python and its libraries is due to their
fast-growing, energetic, and welcoming
<a href="http://neopythonic.blogspot.com/2016/04/kings-day-speech.html">communities</a>.
Those libraries I mentioned are developed in a daily basis by experts from
academia and industry (and also by students through programs like
<a href="https://https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com">Google Summer of Code</a>).

Over the past few years, I've been involved with open source software development
primarily thanks to Google, GitHub, and NASA ❤️.

Here is a list of projects I'm more involved with:

* <a href="https://github.com/keplergo/lightkurve">lightkurve</a>: Sweet astronomical flux time series analysis in Python
* <a href="https://github.com/astropy/astropy">astropy</a>: A community Python library for Astronomy
* <a href="https://github.com/astropy/photutils">photutils</a>: Image photometry in Python
* <a href="https://github.com/keplergo/oktopus">oktopus</a>: Fitting maximum likelihood models in Python made easier
* <a href="https://github.com/mirca/macaw">macaw</a>: Majorization-minimization applied to machine learning

I've been also contributing code and documentation to <a href="https://github.com/numpy/numpy">numpy</a>,
<a href="https://github.com/scipy/scipy">scipy</a>, and
<a href="https://github.com/scikit-optimize/scikit-optimize">scikit-optimize</a>.

Recently, I started to code more frequently in R and C++ in applications of financial engineering and
machine learning. Here a list of projects being developed:

* <a href="https://github.com/dppalomar/spectralGraphTopology">spectralGraphTopology</a>:
An R package for graph learning from data via spectral constraints
* <a href="https://github.com/dppalomar/riskParityPortfolio">riskParityPortfolio</a>:
An R package for fast design of high dimensional risk parity portfolios
* <a href="https://github.com/dppalomar/sparseIndexTracking">sparseIndexTracking</a>:
An R package for the design of portfolio of stocks to track an index
