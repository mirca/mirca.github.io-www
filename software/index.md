Hello world!

In recent years, I've been actively participating in developing open source software in the fields of
financial signal processing, astronomy, and machine learning. Here is a list of projects I've been contributing to:

<b> Financial Signal Processing </b>
* <a href="https://github.com/mirca/riskparity.py">riskparity.py</a>: A Python package
for scalable risk parity portfolios using TensorFlow 2.0
* <a href="https://github.com/dppalomar/riskParityPortfolio">riskParityPortfolio</a>:
An R package for fast design of high dimensional risk parity portfolios

<b> Astronomy </b>
* <a href="https://github.com/astropy/astropy">astropy</a>: A community Python library for Astronomy
* <a href="https://github.com/keplergo/lightkurve">lightkurve</a>: A friendly package for Kepler & TESS time series analysis in Python
* <a href="https://github.com/openastronomy/">openastronomy</a>: A collaboration between open source astronomy projects to share resources, ideas, and code
* <a href="https://github.com/astropy/photutils">photutils</a>: Image photometry in Python

<b> Machine Learning </b>
* <a href="https://github.com/dppalomar/spectralGraphTopology">spectralGraphTopology</a>:
An R package for graph learning and clustering via spectral constraints
