Hi there, my name is <b>Zé</b>!
<br><br>
I'm an undergraduate student majoring in Electrical Engineering at the Federal University of
Campina Grande, Brazil. Since my second semester in college, I've been affiliated with the
<a href="https://www.iecom.org.br">Institute for Advanced Studies in Communications</a> mentored by
<a href="https://scholar.google.com.br/citations?user=NBSmPdAAAAAJ&hl=en">Dr. Marcelo Alencar</a>
and <u>Dr. Danilo Regis</u>.
</p>

<p style='text-align: justify;'>
In 2014, I was awarded a <u>Brazilian Scientific Mobility Program scholarship</u> to study one year abroad
in The Catholic University of America, Washington DC, USA. In that opportunity, I took a variety
of classes among which my favorites were Stochastic Processes, Random Signal Theory, Information
Theory, and Estimation and Detection Theory which are at the core of Machine Learning and
Probabilistic algorithms.

In the Summer of 2015, I had the privilege to be an <u>undergraduate guest researcher</u> at the
Nanofabrication Research Group,
<a href="https://www.nist.gov/cnst">National Institute of Standards and Technology, USA</a>, under
the mentorship of <a href="https://www.nist.gov/people/marcelo-davanco">Dr. Marcelo Davanço</a>.
In that opportunity, I was able to apply the theory I learnt to implement routines in MATLAB for
single molecule localization microscopy and fluorescense localization imaging microscopy.
More precisely, I developed Maximum Likelihood Estimators (along with Fisher Information Matrices)
to localize and measure the brightness of nanoemitters (aka Point Spread Function photometry, in the
astronomy community). This work was part of bigger projects which were later published
on <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-017-00987-6.pdf"><i>Nature Communications</i></a>
and <a href="http://aip.scitation.org/doi/full/10.1063/1.4976578"><i>Review of Scientific Instruments</i></a>.
</p>

In the Spring of 2016, I went back to school in Brazil and got an <u>undergraduate teaching assistant</u>
scholarship for the course of <u>Probability and Statistics for Electrical Engineering and
Computer Science</u>. Besides helping students understand basics concepts of probability theory
during office hours, I also gave weekly lectures during which I solved exercises together with
the students.

During the Summer of 2016, I took a gap semester in my undergraduate studies to become a
<u>software developer</u> for the <a href="https://www.astropy.org">AstroPy Project</a>
as part of the <a href="https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com">Google Summer of Code</a>
program. In that occasion, I developed Python code to perform both unsupervised
clustering and regression of Gaussian Mixture Models for Point Spread Function
photometry. I had the privilege to be mentored by
<a href="http://space.mit.edu/~guenther/">Dr. Hans Moritz Gunther</a>,
<a href="https://github.com/bsipocz">Dr. Brigitta Sipocz</a>, and
<a href="http://www.stsci.edu/~etollerud/">Dr. Erik Tollerud</a>.

In 2017, I was extremely fortunate and privileged to join
<a href="https://keplerscience.arc.nasa.gov">NASA's K2 Mission</a> as an intern
in Silicon Valley, USA. During my time at NASA, I worked on
<a href="https://www.github.com/KeplerGO">software development and scientific
computing</a> problems under the mentorship of <a href="http://geert.io">Dr.
Geert Barentsen</a>, <a href="http://gully.github.io">Dr. Michael Gully-Santiago</a>,
<a href="https://christinasupportsscience.blogspot.com">Dr. Christina Hedges</a>,
and <a href="http://annmariecody.com">Dr. Ann Marie Cody</a>.
</p>

In my spare time, I enjoy taking my dog Pluto for a walk, studying Mandarin,
drinking Brazilian coffee, playing football, writing code for open
source projects, playing chess, and reading historical and technical maths books.
